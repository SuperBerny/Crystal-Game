// I need 4 crystals buttons to display on the page
//At the start of the game the player will be given a random number to match in order to win
    //A new random number must be generated at the start of every new game
//When the player clicks the crystal, it will add specific amount of points to their total.
    //The value of each crystal is hidden from the player
    //The total score will be displayed
    //Crystal point value changes at the start of each new game
//Clicking on a crystal will update the player's score
//The player wins if they match the randomly generated number
//The player loses if they go over the randomly generated number
//The game resets when the player wins or loses
//The game must display total wins and loses
    //!!IMPORTANT!! The game must reset itself. You cannot refresh the page
        //to restart the game
